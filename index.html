<h1>Hello World. This is Sarvil M. Pargi.</h1>
<p>I'll try to share stuff I learn. Moreover, It will help me keep track of the progress I make in whatever I am pursueing and help me in regretting very particularly about when and where exactly I let them hanging the air.    </p>
  <p>  The layout of things I share will fall in the area of (in no particuar order) subsurface geological investigation, thermal conductivity measurement of liquids(hot-wire method) and some fluid simulation projects.  </p>
